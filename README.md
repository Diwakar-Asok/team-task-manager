# Trackify

Trackify is a modern team-based project and task management system built using **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite**.  
It includes role-based access (Admin & Member), project creation, task assignment, board view, team management, and local persistence — all wrapped in a clean, intuitive UI.

This project showcases real-world frontend architecture using modern React patterns, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS styling, and a fully responsive dashboard.
